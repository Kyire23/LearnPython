Tom Sawyer is a boy of about 12 years of age
Tom Sawyer's best friends include Joe Harper and Huckleberry Finn. 
There is no mention of Tom's father, as Tom's mother and father are dead. 
Tom has another aunt, Sally Phelps, who lives very much farther down the Mississippi.
Twain is able to highlight this evolution in Huck's character.
